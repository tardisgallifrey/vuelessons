# Lessons on Vue
### Or, how to translate everything to Reactjs

<p>These are my lessons on Vue.  Vue seems very suited for components, so I am creating a project where each lesson uses one or more loosely connected VUE components</p>

<p>First step is to get the data on the page, a major rule of mine.  Second, I try to play with the code, especially the HTML, to make it look as I wish.  Third, I comment what I think is going on in my own terms.</p>

```npm run serve``` -- don't forget this.
